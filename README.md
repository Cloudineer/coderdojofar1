This is some example files for CoderDojo Faringdon to use as an exercise. They need to make some classes to pass these tests. When code is written to pass all of these tests I will show them how to combine those classes into a pygame application.

## Pass the tests

Download these files into a new folder. To run the tests under Windows, open a command window, by hitting WINDOWS-R then cmd<RETURN>. Then cd into the directory with the python files and type:

$ py -m unittest 

To find where you files are I suggest you open windows explorer and go to My Computer -> C: -> Users -> _your username_, and find the folder where you downloaded these files. That PATH is what you put after _cd_ to change to the right directory.

When you having all of your tests passing, remove the _#_ from the start of the lines for the next test and try that test. Work your way down the test files until all tests pass. 

Remember this is also about teamwork. You do not have to write all of the code yourself, try to share the tests classes; every test must be passed by the group not by each individual.

There are some comments in the test classes to give you hints on how to pass each test.

## Your Mission for Today

There are two classes to write:
* fileops
* linelist

To write them just pass the tests in the related test_xxxx.py file. When the tests pass, then uncomment (ie remove the # from the start of the line) of the next test.

Remember that Google is your friend when it comes to coding. If you get stuck try a search to find an answer. A website called StackOverflow is often the best place for answers to coding questions.

## For the WHIMPS who don't like python

Next week I want to see a firework display in Scratch, with 3 kinds of fireworks, including rockets that leave trails.
